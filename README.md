DMAIC Methodology
Define:
Clearly outline the project objectives, scope, and goals.
Identify key stakeholders and their expectations.
Measure:
Gather relevant data related to the plastic manufacturing processes.
Establish baseline metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs).
Analyze:
Utilize statistical methods to analyze data and identify root causes of issues.
Create visual representations to illustrate findings (e.g., charts, diagrams).
Improve:
Propose and implement process improvements based on the analysis.
Monitor changes and assess their impact on the overall process.
Control:
Develop a plan to sustain improvements and prevent regression.
Implement control measures and continuous monitoring.
